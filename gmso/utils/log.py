    This is done by clearing the logger's associated handlers

    Comments
    --------
    This seems to be cleaner/safer than just setting `logger.handlers = []`
    Creating another list of the handlers is important to avoid simultaneously
    looping and modifying the same list
    We need to reset captureWarnings in order to allow py.warnings to instead
    print to stream rather than the associated filehandler"""
